TODO :
 - in Algorithms: Make it so you can give the starting/center point as a parameter for Drawing Algorithms. Also add default values for them in case someone wants to skip that
 - Make sure that the Point(x,y,z) values are rounded only when plotting & when required for index call
 - Also, maybe add back the displayCharacter for Point class
 - Write various public methods to implement Data Hiding/Abstraction
 - Move all test from Test.java into each algorithm's own main function. Then delete it.
