TODO :
 - in Algorithms: Make it so you can give the starting/center point as a parameter for Drawing Algorithms. Also add default values for them in case someone wants to skip that
 - Analyse usage for Point objects & either convert all to double & round only when plotting, or use int everywhere possible to save on memory/resources
 - Also, maybe add back the displayCharacter for Point class..?
 - Move all tests from Test.java into each algorithm's own main function. Then delete it.
 - Write various public methods to implement Data Hiding/Abstraction for all classes
